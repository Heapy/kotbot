# KotBot Telegram Bot Library

## Goals

- Be minimally opinionated (Keep base models as close to Telegram Bot API as possible, but provide abstraction for productive development on top of it)
- Be lightweight (In terms of LoC, Dependencies and Abstractions)
- Learn Telegram Bot API by writing the library for it 🙃
