### Authorizing your bot


Each bot is given a unique authentication token when it is created. The token looks something like 123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11, but we'll use simply <token> in this document instead. You can learn about obtaining tokens and generating new ones in this document.


### Making requests


All queries to the Telegram Bot API must be served over HTTPS and need to be presented in this form: https://api.telegram.org/bot<token>/METHOD_NAME. Like this for example:


https://api.telegram.org/bot123456:ABC-DEF1234ghIkl-zyx57W2v1u123ew11/getMe


We support GET and POST HTTP methods. We support four ways of passing parameters in Bot API requests:


* URL query string
* application/x-www-form-urlencoded
* application/json (except for uploading files)
* multipart/form-data (use to upload files)


The response contains a JSON object, which always has a Boolean field 'ok' and may have an optional String field 'description' with a human-readable description of the result. If 'ok' equals True, the request was successful and the result of the query can be found in the 'result' field. In case of an unsuccessful request, 'ok' equals false and the error is explained in the 'description'. An Integer 'error_code' field is also returned, but its contents are subject to change in the future. Some errors may also have an optional field 'parameters' of the type ResponseParameters, which can help to automatically handle the error.


* All methods in the Bot API are case-insensitive.
* All queries must be made using UTF-8.


#### Making requests when getting updates


If you're using webhooks, you can perform a request to the Bot API while sending an answer to the webhook. Use either application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data response content type for passing parameters. Specify the method to be invoked in the method parameter of the request. It's not possible to know that such a request was successful or get its result.


> Please see our FAQ for examples.


### Using a Local Bot API Server


The Bot API server source code is available at telegram-bot-api. You can run it locally and send the requests to your own server instead of https://api.telegram.org. If you switch to a local Bot API server, your bot will be able to:


* Download files without a size limit.
* Upload files up to 2000 MB.
* Upload files using their local path and the file URI scheme.
* Use an HTTP URL for the webhook.
* Use any local IP address for the webhook.
* Use any port for the webhook.
* Set max_webhook_connections up to 100000.
* Receive the absolute local path as a value of the file_path field without the need to download the file after a getFile request.


#### Do I need a Local Bot API Server


The majority of bots will be OK with the default configuration, running on our servers. But if you feel that you need one of these features, you're welcome to switch to your own at any time.


### Getting updates


There are two mutually exclusive ways of receiving updates for your bot - the getUpdates method on one hand and webhooks on the other. Incoming updates are stored on the server until the bot receives them either way, but they will not be kept longer than 24 hours.


Regardless of which option you choose, you will receive JSON-serialized Update objects as a result.


#### Update


This object represents an incoming update. At most one of the optional parameters can be present in any given update.


| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |
| update_id | Integer | The update's unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain positive number and increase sequentially. This ID becomes especially handy if you're using webhooks, since it allows you to ignore repeated updates or to restore the correct update sequence, should they get out of order. If there are no new updates for at least a week, then identifier of the next update will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially. |
| message | Message | Optional. New incoming message of any kind - text, photo, sticker, etc. |
| edited_message | Message | Optional. New version of a message that is known to the bot and was edited |
| channel_post | Message | Optional. New incoming channel post of any kind - text, photo, sticker, etc. |
| edited_channel_post | Message | Optional. New version of a channel post that is known to the bot and was edited |
| inline_query | InlineQuery | Optional. New incoming inline query |
| chosen_inline_result | ChosenInlineResult | Optional. The result of an inline query that was chosen by a user and sent to their chat partner. Please see our documentation on the feedback collecting for details on how to enable these updates for your bot. |
| callback_query | CallbackQuery | Optional. New incoming callback query |
| shipping_query | ShippingQuery | Optional. New incoming shipping query. Only for invoices with flexible price |
| pre_checkout_query | PreCheckoutQuery | Optional. New incoming pre-checkout query. Contains full information about checkout |
| poll | Poll | Optional. New poll state. Bots receive only updates about stopped polls and polls, which are sent by the bot |
| poll_answer | PollAnswer | Optional. A user changed their answer in a non-anonymous poll. Bots receive new votes only in polls that were sent by the bot itself. |
| my_chat_member | ChatMemberUpdated | Optional. The bot's chat member status was updated in a chat. For private chats, this update is received only when the bot is blocked or unblocked by the user. |
| chat_member | ChatMemberUpdated | Optional. A chat member's status was updated in a chat. The bot must be an administrator in the chat and must explicitly specify “chat_member” in the list of allowed_updates to receive these updates. |
| chat_join_request | ChatJoinRequest | Optional. A request to join the chat has been sent. The bot must have the can_invite_users administrator right in the chat to receive these updates. |


#### getUpdates


Use this method to receive incoming updates using long polling (wiki). Returns an Array of Update objects.


| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |
| offset | Integer | Optional | Identifier of the first update to be returned. Must be greater by one than the highest among the identifiers of previously received updates. By default, updates starting with the earliest unconfirmed update are returned. An update is considered confirmed as soon as getUpdates is called with an offset higher than its update_id. The negative offset can be specified to retrieve updates starting from -offset update from the end of the updates queue. All previous updates will forgotten. |
| limit | Integer | Optional | Limits the number of updates to be retrieved. Values between 1-100 are accepted. Defaults to 100. |
| timeout | Integer | Optional | Timeout in seconds for long polling. Defaults to 0, i.e. usual short polling. Should be positive, short polling should be used for testing purposes only. |
| allowed_updates | Array of String | Optional | A JSON-serialized list of the update types you want your bot to receive. For example, specify [“message”, “edited_channel_post”, “callback_query”] to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all update types except chat_member (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used. Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to the getUpdates, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time. |


> Notes 1. This method will not work if an outgoing webhook is set up. 2. In order to avoid getting duplicate updates, recalculate offset after each server response.


#### setWebhook


Use this method to specify a URL and receive incoming updates via an outgoing webhook. Whenever there is an update for the bot, we will send an HTTPS POST request to the specified URL, containing a JSON-serialized Update. In case of an unsuccessful request, we will give up after a reasonable amount of attempts. Returns True on success.


If you'd like to make sure that the webhook was set by you, you can specify secret data in the parameter secret_token. If specified, the request will contain a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” with the secret token as content.


| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |
| url | String | Yes | HTTPS URL to send updates to. Use an empty string to remove webhook integration |
| certificate | InputFile | Optional | Upload your public key certificate so that the root certificate in use can be checked. See our self-signed guide for details. |
| ip_address | String | Optional | The fixed IP address which will be used to send webhook requests instead of the IP address resolved through DNS |
| max_connections | Integer | Optional | The maximum allowed number of simultaneous HTTPS connections to the webhook for update delivery, 1-100. Defaults to 40. Use lower values to limit the load on your bot's server, and higher values to increase your bot's throughput. |
| allowed_updates | Array of String | Optional | A JSON-serialized list of the update types you want your bot to receive. For example, specify [“message”, “edited_channel_post”, “callback_query”] to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all update types except chat_member (default). If not specified, the previous setting will be used. Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to the setWebhook, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time. |
| drop_pending_updates | Boolean | Optional | Pass True to drop all pending updates |
| secret_token | String | Optional | A secret token to be sent in a header “X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token” in every webhook request, 1-256 characters. Only characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and - are allowed. The header is useful to ensure that the request comes from a webhook set by you. |


> Notes 1. You will not be able to receive updates using getUpdates for as long as an outgoing webhook is set up. 2. To use a self-signed certificate, you need to upload your public key certificate using certificate parameter. Please upload as InputFile, sending a String will not work. 3. Ports currently supported for webhooks: 443, 80, 88, 8443. If you're having any trouble setting up webhooks, please check out this amazing guide to webhooks.

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  |
| drop_pending_updates | Boolean | Optional | Pass True to drop all pending updates |

| game_short_name | String | Optional. Short name of a Game to be returned, serves as the unique identifier for the game |


> NOTE: After the user presses a callback button, Telegram clients will display a progress bar until you call answerCallbackQuery. It is, therefore, necessary to react by calling answerCallbackQuery even if no notification to the user is needed (e.g., without specifying any of the optional parameters).


#### ForceReply


Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will display a reply interface to the user (act as if the user has selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply'). This can be extremely useful if you want to create user-friendly step-by-step interfaces without having to sacrifice privacy mode.


| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  |
| force_reply | True | Shows reply interface to the user, as if they manually selected the bot's message and tapped 'Reply' |
| input_field_placeholder | String | Optional. The placeholder to be shown in the input field when the reply is active; 1-64 characters |
| selective | Boolean | Optional. Use this parameter if you want to force reply from specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the text of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has reply_to_message_id), sender of the original message. |


> Example: A poll bot for groups runs in privacy mode (only receives commands, replies to its messages and mentions). There could be two ways to create a new poll: Explain the user how to send a command with parameters (e.g. /newpoll question answer1 answer2). May be appealing for hardcore users but lacks modern day polish. Guide the user through a step-by-step process. 'Please send me your question', 'Cool, now let's add the first answer option', 'Great. Keep adding answer options, then send /done when you're ready'. The last option is definitely more attractive. And if you use ForceReply in your bot's questions, it will receive the user's answers even if it only receives replies, commands and mentions - without any extra work for the user.

#### InputFile


This object represents the contents of a file to be uploaded. Must be posted using multipart/form-data in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser.


#### Sending files


There are three ways to send files (photos, stickers, audio, media, etc.):


1. If the file is already stored somewhere on the Telegram servers, you don't need to reupload it: each file object has a file_id field, simply pass this file_id as a parameter instead of uploading. There are no limits for files sent this way.
1. Provide Telegram with an HTTP URL for the file to be sent. Telegram will download and send the file. 5 MB max size for photos and 20 MB max for other types of content.
1. Post the file using multipart/form-data in the usual way that files are uploaded via the browser. 10 MB max size for photos, 50 MB for other files.


Sending by file_id


* It is not possible to change the file type when resending by file_id. I.e. a video can't be sent as a photo, a photo can't be sent as a document, etc.
* It is not possible to resend thumbnails.
* Resending a photo by file_id will send all of its sizes.
* file_id is unique for each individual bot and can't be transferred from one bot to another.
* file_id uniquely identifies a file, but a file can have different valid file_ids even for the same bot.


Sending by URL


* When sending by URL the target file must have the correct MIME type (e.g., audio/mpeg for sendAudio, etc.).
* In sendDocument, sending by URL will currently only work for GIF, PDF and ZIP files.
* To use sendVoice, the file must have the type audio/ogg and be no more than 1MB in size. 1-20MB voice notes will be sent as files.
* Other configurations may work but we can't guarantee that they will.


#### Inline mode objects


Objects and methods used in the inline mode are described in the Inline mode section.

Use either URL query string or application/json or application/x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart/form-data for passing parameters in Bot API requests. On successful call, a JSON-object containing the result will be returned.


#### getMe


A simple method for testing your bot's authentication token. Requires no parameters. Returns basic information about the bot in form of a User object.


#### logOut


Use this method to log out from the cloud Bot API server before launching the bot locally. You must log out the bot before running it locally, otherwise there is no guarantee that the bot will receive updates. After a successful call, you can immediately log in on a local server, but will not be able to log in back to the cloud Bot API server for 10 minutes. Returns True on success. Requires no parameters.


#### close


Use this method to close the bot instance before moving it from one local server to another. You need to delete the webhook before calling this method to ensure that the bot isn't launched again after server restart. The method will return error 429 in the first 10 minutes after the bot is launched. Returns True on success. Requires no parameters.


#### sendMessage


Use this method to send text messages. On success, the sent Message is returned.

#### Formatting options


The Bot API supports basic formatting for messages. You can use bold, italic, underlined, strikethrough, and spoiler text, as well as inline links and pre-formatted code in your bots' messages. Telegram clients will render them accordingly. You can specify text entities directly, or use markdown-style or HTML-style formatting.


Note that Telegram clients will display an alert to the user before opening an inline link ('Open this link?' together with the full URL).


Message entities can be nested, providing following restrictions are met: - If two entities have common characters, then one of them is fully contained inside another. - bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, and spoiler entities can contain and can be part of any other entities, except pre and code. - All other entities can't contain each other.


Links tg://user?id=<user_id> can be used to mention a user by their ID without using a username. Please note:


* These links will work only if they are used inside an inline link or in an inline keyboard button. For example, they will not work, when used in a message text.
* Unless the user is a member of the chat where they were mentioned, these mentions are only guaranteed to work if the user has contacted the bot in private in the past or has sent a callback query to the bot via an inline button and doesn't have Forwarded Messages privacy enabled for the bot.


###### MarkdownV2 style


To use this mode, pass MarkdownV2 in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:


*bold \*text*
_italic \*text_
__underline__
~strikethrough~
||spoiler||
*bold _italic bold ~italic bold strikethrough ||italic bold strikethrough spoiler||~ __underline italic bold___ bold*
[inline URL](http://www.example.com/)
[inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)
`inline fixed-width code`
```
pre-formatted fixed-width code block
```
```python
pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language
```


Please note:


* Any character with code between 1 and 126 inclusively can be escaped anywhere with a preceding '\' character, in which case it is treated as an ordinary character and not a part of the markup. This implies that '\' character usually must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
* Inside pre and code entities, all '`' and '\' characters must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
* Inside (...) part of inline link definition, all ')' and '\' must be escaped with a preceding '\' character.
* In all other places characters '_', '*', '[', ']', '(', ')', '~', '`', '>', '#', '+', '-', '=', '|', '{', '}', '.', '!' must be escaped with the preceding character '\'.
* In case of ambiguity between italic and underline entities __ is always greadily treated from left to right as beginning or end of underline entity, so instead of ___italic underline___ use ___italic underline_\r__, where \r is a character with code 13, which will be ignored.


###### HTML style


To use this mode, pass HTML in the parse_mode field. The following tags are currently supported:


<b>bold</b>, <strong>bold</strong>
<i>italic</i>, <em>italic</em>
<u>underline</u>, <ins>underline</ins>
<s>strikethrough</s>, <strike>strikethrough</strike>, <del>strikethrough</del>
<span class="tg-spoiler">spoiler</span>, <tg-spoiler>spoiler</tg-spoiler>
<b>bold <i>italic bold <s>italic bold strikethrough <span class="tg-spoiler">italic bold strikethrough spoiler</span></s> <u>underline italic bold</u></i> bold</b>
<a href="http://www.example.com/">inline URL</a>
<a href="tg://user?id=123456789">inline mention of a user</a>
<code>inline fixed-width code</code>
<pre>pre-formatted fixed-width code block</pre>
<pre><code class="language-python">pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language</code></pre>


Please note:


* Only the tags mentioned above are currently supported.
* All <, > and & symbols that are not a part of a tag or an HTML entity must be replaced with the corresponding HTML entities (< with &lt;, > with &gt; and & with &amp;).
* All numerical HTML entities are supported.
* The API currently supports only the following named HTML entities: &lt;, &gt;, &amp; and &quot;.
* Use nested pre and code tags, to define programming language for pre entity.
* Programming language can't be specified for standalone code tags.


###### Markdown style


This is a legacy mode, retained for backward compatibility. To use this mode, pass Markdown in the parse_mode field. Use the following syntax in your message:


*bold text*
_italic text_
[inline URL](http://www.example.com/)
[inline mention of a user](tg://user?id=123456789)
`inline fixed-width code`
```
pre-formatted fixed-width code block
```
```python
pre-formatted fixed-width code block written in the Python programming language
```


Please note:


* Entities must not be nested, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.
* There is no way to specify underline and strikethrough entities, use parse mode MarkdownV2 instead.
* To escape characters '_', '*', '`', '[' outside of an entity, prepend the characters '\' before them.
* Escaping inside entities is not allowed, so entity must be closed first and reopened again: use _snake_\__case_ for italic snake_case and *2*\**2=4* for bold 2*2=4.

| cache_time | Integer | Optional | The maximum amount of time in seconds that the result of the inline query may be cached on the server. Defaults to 300. |
| is_personal | Boolean | Optional | Pass True if results may be cached on the server side only for the user that sent the query. By default, results may be returned to any user who sends the same query |
| next_offset | String | Optional | Pass the offset that a client should send in the next query with the same text to receive more results. Pass an empty string if there are no more results or if you don't support pagination. Offset length can't exceed 64 bytes. |
| switch_pm_text | String | Optional | If passed, clients will display a button with specified text that switches the user to a private chat with the bot and sends the bot a start message with the parameter switch_pm_parameter |
| switch_pm_parameter | String | Optional | Deep-linking parameter for the /start message sent to the bot when user presses the switch button. 1-64 characters, only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and - are allowed. Example: An inline bot that sends YouTube videos can ask the user to connect the bot to their YouTube account to adapt search results accordingly. To do this, it displays a 'Connect your YouTube account' button above the results, or even before showing any. The user presses the button, switches to a private chat with the bot and, in doing so, passes a start parameter that instructs the bot to return an OAuth link. Once done, the bot can offer a switch_inline button so that the user can easily return to the chat where they wanted to use the bot's inline capabilities. |

### Games


Your bot can offer users HTML5 games to play solo or to compete against each other in groups and one-on-one chats. Create games via @BotFather using the /newgame command. Please note that this kind of power requires responsibility: you will need to accept the terms for each game that your bots will be offering.


* Games are a new type of content on Telegram, represented by the Game and InlineQueryResultGame objects.
* Once you've created a game via BotFather, you can send games to chats as regular messages using the sendGame method, or use inline mode with InlineQueryResultGame.
* If you send the game message without any buttons, it will automatically have a 'Play GameName' button. When this button is pressed, your bot gets a CallbackQuery with the game_short_name of the requested game. You provide the correct URL for this particular user and the app opens the game in the in-app browser.
* You can manually add multiple buttons to your game message. Please note that the first button in the first row must always launch the game, using the field callback_game in InlineKeyboardButton. You can add extra buttons according to taste: e.g., for a description of the rules, or to open the game's official community.
* To make your game more attractive, you can upload a GIF animation that demostrates the game to the users via BotFather (see Lumberjack for example).
* A game message will also display high scores for the current chat. Use setGameScore to post high scores to the chat with the game, add the edit_message parameter to automatically update the message with the current scoreboard.
* Use getGameHighScores to get data for in-game high score tables.
* You can also add an extra sharing button for users to share their best score to different chats.
* For examples of what can be done using this new stuff, check the @gamebot and @gamee bots.
