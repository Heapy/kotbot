# kotbot [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Heapy/kotbot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Heapy/kotbot)

Bot for Kotlin chats in telegram.

## Docker Image

Project distributed as docker image, and available in [docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/heapy/kotbot/).

## Why?

Combot becomes paid.

## Development

1. Use [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather) to create bot which you will use for testing;
2. You need to pass bot token that you received from BotFather to Bot, here two available options:
   1. Copy `./devops/.env-template-dev` to `./devops/.env` and replace `id:secret` with bot token;
   2. Set env variable `KOTBOT_TOKEN` to token value in Intellij IDEA's "Run/Debug Configuration";
3. Run main in `io.heapy.kotbot.Application`.

That's it, you have running bot, now add him to some chat and grant admin rules (in order to delete messages and kick users), and test it.

## TODO

### Moderation

User can't send messages, until he add this bot and answer on bot's sign up questions.

#### Bot commands

* `/stats` Display your statistics: number of warnings and helpful flags.

#### Administrative commands

These commands only work for group admins.

* `!mute [reason]` Reply to a user to mute them for 24 hours;
* `!fmute [reason]` is forever mute;
* `!unmute` Reply to a user to unmute them;
* `!channelmode` Enable read-only mode. Only admins can send messages. Send the command again to disable the mode;
* `!warn [reason]` Reply to a user to warn them. User will receive personal warning messages through bot. First warn just send message, second - mutes for 24 hours, third - mutes user forever. Warnings expires over time.

#### Community commands

These commands work for everybody.

`!report` Reply to a message to report it to admins;
`+1` Reply to a message to mark it as helpful.

### Stats

#### Per User

* Flood %: (Avg. Message Length for chat) / (Avg. Message Length for user)
* Active Days: Number of days when user was active
* Messages: Number of sent messages
* Activity: Frequency of messages and the length

#### Values

* Total messages (week, month, year, lifetime)
* Avg. daily messages
* Avg. messages per hour 
* Active users (week, month, year, lifetime)
* Avg. daily users
* Community health
  > Community health tells you how engaged the community is. 100% means that at least 20% of the community is engaged and creates at least 80% of the content. If this becomes more balanced (for eg 100% of the content is created by 50% of the people) youâ€™ll see a number above 100. On the other hand, if the community is imbalanced and all the content is created by a handful of contributors, the community health will drop below 100%.
* User grows: Number of new users per day
* User loss: Number of users leaves per day

#### Graphs

* Active users: Users/Day (Users who posted at least 1 text message during the day.)
* Chat Activity: Messages/Day (Activity distribution is based on message length & count.)
* Active days of the week: Messages/Week Day
* Active hours: Messages/Day Time
* Most active months: Messages/Month
* Num of users

### Restrictions

* User can't send audios, videos, video notes and voice notes.
* User can't send animations, games, stickers and use inline bots. 

### Automation

* Delete bot calls (if any)
* Delete joins
* Delete commands 
* Delete videos & GIFs
* Delete games 
* Delete voices
